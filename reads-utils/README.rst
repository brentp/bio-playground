quality usage table::

   fastq summarize --adjust 64 --codon some.fastq

creates a table with columns of quality values for percentiles: 
0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.9, 0.95, 0.99 and for median. each
row is a read position (useful for seeing how quality declines with
increasing read position).

filter
++++++

run ./fastq with no arguments to see help for filtering.
